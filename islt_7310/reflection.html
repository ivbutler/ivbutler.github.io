    <h1>Reflection</h1>
  <p>As I mentioned earlier, one of my personal goals is to cultivate an empathetic and understanding approach to my work, not only in the library field, but also throughout my career, as eclectic as it has been! Library and information services first and foremost must serve the person, not the program. It is our responsibility as information specialists to be aware of our biases and who might be left out of services, in particular how technology can be created with underlying, unconscious biases that then affect the end-user. I am interested in a diversity of experiences, and as such, my career path has followed this guiding principle. By exploring a variety of jobs, I’ve been able to approach library science with an understanding that is not just limited to the field. 
</p>
<p>While I was pursuing my Bachelor’s of Art in English, I was also working for the University of Washington, Spokane, as a student assistant in one of the research greenhouses. There I tended to several hundred plants on a daily basis, ensuring their welfare and assisting the various graduate and postdoctoral researchers with their tasks. This gave me the valuable insight not only into English but also the plant sciences. Before transferring to an English degree, I had been previously interested in agriculture, so I was able to use my previous studies at my work. 
</p>
<p>
Both my English degree and my plant-science work entailed a high level of detail-oriented precision, which I had honed with my volunteer position at the New Orleans Public Library. There, I located materials that patrons had put on hold, which involved searching through the shelves. I had to quickly learn my library’s classification system as well as how to shelve books correctly so that another person might be able to find them. Additionally, my present work as an editorial assistant also entails a high degree of precision not only in copyediting, but also from a technical standpoint. I became fluent in switching from HTML mark-up to the text as the webpage would display it, and learned how to troubleshoot common problems that arose when the article text was transferred into the website coding. 
</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A strength of my career path has been its variety. By not pigeonholing myself into my particular field, I have the advantage of being able to approach a problem creatively and from a variety of perspectives that otherwise might go unconsidered. As I am currently studying to be a librarian, I am obviously hopeful that I will be able to make the most of my studies and job opportunities to be able to serve the information needs of the public and the academic communities, depending on where my career path takes me. My goal as a librarian is to ensure that everyone is being served, including disabled people and other marginalized communities. Society and its technological expressions must serve the people, not the other way around.
