<h1>Professional Experience</h1>
<h2>Online Editorial Assistant, Real Books Publication, New York, NY, 2019-present</h2>
<p>In my employment at Real Books Publication, I work as an editorial assistant, being responsible for transferring the magazine content to its various websites and apps. I also work as the first point of contact for bloggers, and ensure that their submitted materials comply with the house style guide. I’m content with how I am handling work there.</p>

 <section id="section2">
<h2>Student Assistant, University of Washington, Spokane, 2016-2017</h2>
<p>While studying English, I worked in a research greenhouse, which was one of the most transformative points of my life. I cared for research plants and assisted various researchers, including my supervisor, in obtaining and preserving plant genetic material. I greatly enjoyed it and helping to contribute to scientific discoveries in the field. If I had to do things again, I might have applied for the job or similar ones earlier in my university career.</p>
</section>
<section id="section3">
    <h2>Library Assistant, New Orleans Public Library, News Orleans, LA, 2010-2011</h2>
<p>This was my starting point in my career, and as such, I have fond memories of it. I volunteered as assistant to the head librarian, and my duties entailed pulling holds for patrons, preparing crafts for the children’s activities, and keeping the children’s area neat and tidy. If I had to do it over again, I might have begun earlier, as it was something I greatly enjoyed, even if it didn’t result in any major accomplishments.</p></section>
