<p>Hello and welcome! I am an aspiring librarian and a first-year graduate student in the University of Missouri’s Master’s of Library and Information Science program, with an expected graduation date of early 2022. Prior to moving to New York, I’ve lived in France, Washington, and Louisiana, and I am eager to check out the rest of the world! I enjoy researching eclectic materials, and I am passionate about helping others with their information needs. As I have a postgraduate degree in children’s and young adult literature, it probably comes as no surprise that one of my favorite quotes is from Frances Hodgson Burnett’s <em>The Secret Garden</em>. Its optimistic and empathetic approach to the world is one that I hope to cultivate in my work. It also speaks to my love of gardening and nature.</p>
